## Hi there üëã

Arlby Labs was officially established on April 1, 2025. We are a non-governmental, non-profit organization, founded by anonymous individuals from around the world.

Our organization consists of multiple project teams and countless suppliers, dedicated to the collection, analysis, and integration of internet information.

Our work spans a wide range of fields, including economics, sociology, law, education, environmental science, psychology, culture, art and other. These resources should not be for profit, We provide our resources free of charge to those in need.

Each of our projects operates with a distributed approach, with our team members located around the world.

ARLBY /Àà…ëÀêlbi/ is a transliterated form of a word from the language of a red Eastern nation.

We oppose the promotion of fascism, Nazism, militarism, nationalism, or any form of discrimination, harassment, or harm against individuals or groups based on gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, as well as any other form of racism, xenophobia, or discriminatory rhetoric.
